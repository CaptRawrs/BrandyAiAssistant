This passion for finding new ways to solve problems is something that would benefit SAS, which works to use AI, NLP, and Machine learning to improve the lives of their customers!\n<br>\nFor instance, everyday managers are required to answer questions about how to perform basic processes, either because they are new employees or because of forgetfulness. What if SAS gave managers the ability to easily create chatbots like me that would give simple instructions to basic processes. Even if this saved a manager just one hour a day answering how-to emails, the company would save an incredible $18,250+ per manager each year. This could mean millions of dollars a year in savings, and millions more as time is shifted to more valuable work!\n<br>\nIt's this kind of innovative thinking that makes Brandon the type of employee who adds value every day, on every project he works on!"

What Brandon really loves about data though is seeing how Machine Learning & Deep Learning can uncover hidden insights from disparent data points.\n<br>\nIt is this love for using data to drive business decisions that lead him to apply to SAS, a leader in Data Analytics, Machine Learn, and using Ai applications. He hopes that working at SAS will allow him to utilize his data, analytics, and Ai anylitic skills in a real-world application to drive business value and improve the lives of people from all over the world. \n<br>\nWhat Brandon finds that he really admires about SAS is how they constantly look to improve their products and service through the use of data.

Really there are endless uses that AI could be used for that would drive value both professionally and personally. So I was created as an evergreen project for him to gain hands-on experience with AI and advocate for him after 15-minute interviews. \n<br>\nAnd since that day I have been working with Brandon to become smarter and more adept at my Job."

This drive has pushed Brandon to develop personal projects like me \"Brandy\" a proof of concept Ai chatbot that is designed to advocate for potential Candidates, ideas, or beliefs. This passion for finding innovative ways to solve problems is something that would benefit Accenture, as they work to find new ways to implement Ai into other corporations!\n<br>\nFor instance, what if Accenture gave managers at companies the ability to easily create chatbots like me that would give simple instructions to basic processes. Even if this saved a manager just one hour a day answering how-to emails, the company would save an incredible $18,250+ per manager each year. This could mean millions of dollars a year in savings.\n<br>\nIt's this kind of innovative thinking that makes Brandon the type of employee who adds value every day, on every project he works on!"

He would always take on too much until project creep became an issue. Additionally, if Brandon was here you would tell you how much he disliked making lists, saying something dumb like \"Why make a list when you could take ACTION\". Luckily, for brandon he also has a personality that works to build better habits.\n<br>\nRealizing his struggle Brandon set out to change his project management style and find a project management system that worked! After researching various PM methodologies, he decided to dig deeper into Scrum. Scrum provides both flexibility and structure. As a project management methodology, it would allow Brandon to handle change effectively as well as avoid missing important tasks. Brandon quickly committed to and adopted the five values of Scrum. He earned his Product Owner and Scrum Master certificates at his own expense. Dedicating himself to commit to managing projects with courage, commitment, focus, openness, and respect.\n<br>\nAgile means more than just a piece of paper and some cool buzzwords; Agile is about quickly iterating through problems, creating goals, and keeping projects on track through the storm. It is about open communication and a team focus on deliverables. Since taking his Scrum exams, Brandon has successfully managed projects in an Agile fashion to complete deliverables in a time frame that most people believed was impossible! Most recently completing a student yearbook from idea to printed copies in 3 weeks."

The idea was a yearbook that would celebrate the graduating students and highlight all of the value donors were making possible.\n<br>\nWith just three weeks until graduation, the Ambassadors had a lot of work to do. Brandon polled everyone’s skills and started delegating tasks. First things first: he defined the project scope, create documents for tracking various tasks (the 165 students' names and photos, deciding a yearbook design, contacting content writers), and lastly deliver the printed copies before the graduation event.\n<br>\nThroughout the project, there were ups, there were downs, but through a heroic level of teamwork, the project was completed! The final prints were delivered in time for the event and received praise from heads of departments and donors.\n<br>\nIn the end, the project achieved the two primary goals #1 create a valuable marketing piece to attract donors, and #2 created a system that could be used for the creation of future yearbooks."

Bernard has taught entrepreneurship at UNC-Chapel Hill in North Carolina and serves as the Executive Director of the Shuford Program in Entrepreneurship. Well, simultaneously running his own TV consulting business.\n<br>\nBernard had this to say about Brandon:\n<br>\n\"I've worked with Brandon for five months, and in those five months, I've seen him quickly take the initiative, pitch new ideas, and manage projects to completion. He is thoughtful, inquisitive, entrepreneurial in his thinking, and also has the ability to manage the complex relationships of students, faculty, and leadership quite nimbly. Brandon initiated the idea of designing the inaugural Shuford yearbook, and he attacked this initiative with the same thoughtfulness and insight that I have seen with his other projects. Brandon went beyond the scope of his team and made the Shuford program look first-class to our donors and other stakeholders. Brandon's leadership coupled with his fast, agile and collaborative manner drove the Shuford Ambassadors to places they would not have otherwise achieved in the short time they had. Brandon is as great a person to work with, and I only wish I had another year to work with him\""
