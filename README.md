The Goal here is to create a Chatbot that Recruiters can learn more about the candidate without having to talk with them.

I recommend taking the IBM coursara class Buildig AI Powered Chatbots without programming:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-ai-powered-chatbots?skipBrowseRedirect=true

It will help you get off that ground running, and its free if you complete it within 7-days (an easy task)

1. The first thing you will need to do is to create a account with IBM to use their Watson. You can do that here:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant
2. Create an Assistant - (Name it whatever you like)
3. Create a Skill - (The name with be overwritten in the next steps)
4. Open the menu on the Skill ---> select upload ---> upload the file titled "skill-AI-Assistant---To-Share"
5. Now you can go ahead and remove all of my content and add your own.


Note* If you have no experiece with IBM Watson Assistant then you may find it difficult to edit the feilds without the chatbot send people off into random nodes. So I highly recommend taking the coursara course on making IBM chatbots.
