Things like requests from co-workers who could not remember a 3-step process or advocate for a cause by answering commonly asked questions. There are endless uses in which you could use AI. That would drive value both professionally and personally. So I was created as an evergreen project for Brandon to gain hands-on experience with AI and advocate for him after 15-minute interviews.

He learned to make decisions this way after running an e-commerce business that required him to analyze large amounts of search data and utilize that data to drive revenue for his e-commerce company. What excites Brandon about data is seeing how Machine Learning & Deep Learning can uncover hidden insights from disparate data points.\n<br>\nThis love for using data to drive business decisions has led him to apply to SAS, a leader in Data Analytics, Machine Learn, and Ai applications. He hopes that working at SAS will allow him to utilize these skills in a real-world application to drive business value through data, analytics, and Ai. \n<br>\nBrandon's mind, there is no better company to gain these practical experiences than SAS!\nBrandon finds that he admires about SAS is how they constantly look to improve their products and service through the use of data. This drive for innovation has led to the evolution of one of their core product SAS Viya, a program used to drive value by quickly transforming raw data into operational insights!\n"

After researching various PM methodologies, he decided to dig deeper into Scrum. Scrum provides both flexibility and structure, and as a project management methodology, it would allow Brandon to handle change effectively and pinpoint essential tasks. Brandon quickly committed to and adopted the five values of Scrum. He earned his Product Owner and Scrum Master certificates at his own expense. He was dedicating himself to managing projects with courage, commitment, focus, openness, and respect.\n<br>\nAgile means more than just a piece of paper and some cool buzzwords; Agile is about quickly iterating through problems, creating goals, and keeping projects on track through the storm. It is about open communication and a team focus on deliverables. Since taking his Scrum exams, Brandon has successfully managed projects in an Agile fashion to complete deliverables in a time frame that most people believed was impossible! Most recently completing a student yearbook from idea to printed copies in 3 weeks."

By paying close attention and genuinely listening, Brandon gets a clear understanding of what they do, what they need, and what their goals are. He can then continue to work with clients collaboratively to find solutions for their most pressing problems.\n<br>\nLastly, Brandon wants to bring a more human element to AI.

Brandon polled everyone's skills and started delegating tasks.

He is thoughtful, inquisitive, entrepreneurial in his thinking, and also has the ability to manage the complex relationships of students, faculty, and leadership quite nimbly. Brandon initiated the idea of designing the inaugural Shuford yearbook, and he attacked this initiative with the same thoughtfulness and insight that I have seen with his other projects. Brandon went beyond the scope of his team and made the Shuford program look first-class to our donors and other stakeholders. Brandon's leadership coupled with his fast, agile and collaborative manner drove the Shuford Ambassadors to places they would not have otherwise achieved in the short time they had.
